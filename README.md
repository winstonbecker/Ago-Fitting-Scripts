**Modeling Scripts:**
_align_guide_target_seqs.py_: Script for alignment of guide and target sequences to predict the binding register prior to model fitting. Parameters for alignment are estimated from single mismatch penalties. 

**Parameter Fitting Scripts:**
_fitOnRates.py_: Fits association rates to RNA-MaP data. 
_cleaveAndSeqCounts.py_: Counts exact matches of sequences. 
_cleaveAndSeqFitCounts.py_: Fits cleavage rates to counts data.
